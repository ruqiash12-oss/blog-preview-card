## 💻 Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Responsive design using media queries
- Google Fonts (Figtree 500 & 800)
- Flexbox & Grid layout

## 🚀 What I Learned

While building this project, I practiced:

- Structuring a clean and accessible HTML layout
- Styling components with consistent spacing and hierarchy
- Using `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, and `hover` effects for visual depth
- Applying responsive design principles for mobile screens
- Integrating custom fonts from Google Fonts
- Writing semantic and maintainable CSS

## 📱 Responsive Design

The layout adapts to different screen sizes using a mobile-first approach. On smaller screens, the card resizes and margins adjust for better readability.
